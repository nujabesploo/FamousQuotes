# 📜 Famous Quotes Generator  

## 📌 Overview  
The **Famous Quotes Generator** is a simple Java-based console application that delivers **short yet impactful quotes** based on user input. It allows users to enter a number between **1 and 10** and receive an inspiring message in return. The program also features an option to continue generating quotes or exit gracefully.

## ⚡ Features  
✔️ **Randomized Quote Selection** – Returns a predefined famous quote based on user input  
✔️ **User Input Validation** – Ensures the entered number is within the valid range  
✔️ **Error Handling** – Prevents crashes by catching invalid inputs  
✔️ **Looping Option** – Allows users to generate multiple quotes until they decide to exit

## 🏗️ How It Works  
1. The program prompts the user to enter a **number between 1 and 10**.  
2. If the input is valid, the system **retrieves and displays** the corresponding quote.  
3. If an invalid input (e.g., text or out-of-range number) is entered, an **error message** appears.  
4. The program then asks if the user wants to generate another quote.  
   - Enter **"Yes"** to continue.  
   - Enter **"No"** to exit.
